        <p>Nerdy, geeky, young African American male that is always looking to defy stereotypes, give back to surrounding communities, and understands the importance of self reflection.</p>
        <p>I enjoy talks and discussion about new tech whether it is in the , Electric and autonomous vehicles, the blockchain space, what javascript framework is "IN" these days, or the common 'AI' is taking all the jobs.</p>
        <p>I have worked primarily in the auto and finance/payment industry. I am constantly working on small ideas that I hope to build out and make a career of as well one day.</p>
